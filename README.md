# qsreact

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sam-Chow/qsreact.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sam-Chow/qsreact)

â›± this is a *q*uite *s*imple react, just for fun!

## features ðŸ‘€

1. using `JSX` for elements
1. supporting funtional and class Components, as well as text Components and dom Components which are quiet normal for construct a dom tree
1. passing props (which are the same as dom props) to drive the virtual dom changing, and this will change the dom tree meanwhile
1. rendering an entire qsreact virtual dom to a real dom node just like react do

## todos next ðŸ—’

1. state for class Component (actually I have tried to do this)
1. to bind event handlers to the virtual dom automaticlly
1. and more

## build and run

build: `yarn run build`

wanna see how qsreact works and have a try? just `yarn run dev:example`
